# Skyblivion.OBSLexicalParser

This project is a C# conversion of https://github.com/TESSkyblivion/skyblivion-ScriptConverter/tree/master/src/Ormin/OBSLexicalParser, which is written in PHP.

The original PHP project depends on https://github.com/jakubledl/dissect and https://github.com/TESSkyblivion/esreader.  So, to convert this project, I had to convert its references as well.  This project includes my C# conversion of Dissect (https://github.com/jakubledl/dissect).  https://github.com/wessleym/Skyblivion.ESReader is a separate project.

This project does not yet build.  It has just a few compilation errors.

To set up the project on your computer, be sure to download this project and https://github.com/wessleym/Skyblivion.ESReader.
